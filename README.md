# Cover Story Generator
A cover story generator for people who Need Quick Covers On Operations


## Why? 
in my own Operational Security, I live in an area where it can be dangerous saying where you work, your family name, or basic details for life. To circumvent this depending on the scenario I have a set of covers, for example, At the Barbers, I am john O'Shea from Dublin I work as an insurance broker, married with a young child. While at my Building suppliers I am Stephen Burke a Farmhand from Meath, single with no family who loves football. 

I wanted to write a tool for two reasons 1 - practice coding and 2 - to give a tool that will do this for others who build a backstory. this has alot of uses special for investigations.
